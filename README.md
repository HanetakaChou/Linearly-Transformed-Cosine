- [x] brx_linearly_transformed_cosine_optimization.h: precomputing the LTC (Linearly Transformed Cosine) LUT (Look-Up Table) matrices  
- [x] brx_linearly_transformed_cosine_radiance.bsli: the form factor is computed on the fly and then multiplied by the albedo to obtain the radiance  
- [x] brx_linearly_transformed_cosine_attenuation.bsli: back-face & distance culling
